So you are interested in contributing to this project.

Here is what I would like lycheese to have:

- implement the camera source, maybe look at [this][v4l2src] before doing anything
- implement the [picture in picture][pic_in_pic] to show webcam and screen in the same stream
- comply to the Gnome human interface guidelines
- A cool icon!

If there is anything else you would like to contribute fell free, I accept pretty much anything.

And most important remember to add yourself to the AUTHOR file!
