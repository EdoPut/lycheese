So you are interested in contributing to this project.

Here is what I would like lycheese to have:

- implement the camera source, maybe look at [this][v4l2src] before
- implement the [picture in picture][pic_in_pic] to show webcam and screen in the same stream
- comply to the Gnome human interface guidelines


[v4l2src]: http://wiki.oz9aec.net/index.php/Gstreamer_cheat_sheet#Webcam_Capture
[pic_in_pic]: http://wiki.oz9aec.net/index.php/Gstreamer_cheat_sheet#Picture_in_Picture
